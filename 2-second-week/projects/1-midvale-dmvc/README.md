# BC Data Science Workshop 2017

## Project 1: Midvale

## Instructions to get started

* Similar to Thursday, the data can be found in `~/data/1-Donaldson/`.
* For a brief summary of what is to be done with data, Roger will 
  walk you through some of the details. The slides from that presentation
  can be 
  [found here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rfDGpnmiGpOjtWt9oeuL3_hMATKf8Cb_sEG8OcoZzU8).
* To keep track of your progress as a group and commemorate what you've 
  accomplished, start by creating a 
  [new GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)
  and pasting the link to it below.
* Be sure to read the README from Roger in the data directory; it
  includes License and Copyright information.
