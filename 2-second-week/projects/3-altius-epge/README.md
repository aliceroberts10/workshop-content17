# BC Data Science Workshop 2017

## Instructions to get started

* Read the [markdown file](./bc-data-workshop-Altius.md) in this folder to get started. 
* In order to read in the genetic data, you will need Julia. Julia can be downloaded 
  locally on your machine; is available on [ubc.syzygy.ca] and [sfu.syzygy.ca] and *might*
  be available on this machine by the time you need it (fingers crossed). 
* You can find the data required for this project in `~/data/3-Simon/`. 
* Make a new repository on GitHub so that your team can have a unified place to manage 
  (and commemorate) progress. 
* **Paste this link below and submit a pull request to add it to the master branch of the
  workshop-content repository.**
